<h4 style="color:green" id="proArea">What is a "protected area"?</h4>

<p align=justify>Protected areas – national parks, wilderness areas, community conserved areas, nature reserves and so on – are a mainstay of biodiversity conservation, while also contributing to people’s livelihoods, particularly at the local level. Protected areas are at the core of efforts towards conserving nature and the services it provides us – food, clean water supply, medicines and protection from the impacts of natural disasters. Their role in helping mitigate and adapt to climate change is also increasingly recognized; it has been estimated that the global network of protected areas stores at least 15% of terrestrial carbon.

Global map of PAsPhoto: IUCN and WCMCHelping countries and communities designate and manage systems of protected areas on land and in the oceans, is one of IUCN’s main areas of expertise. Together with species conservation, this has been a key focus of attention of IUCN’s work and of a vast majority of IUCN Member organizations. Effectively managed systems of protected areas have been recognized as critical instruments in achieving the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Sustainable Development Goals</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Protected areas</b> or <b>conservation areas</b> are locations which receive protection because of their recognized natural, ecological or cultural values. There are several kinds of protected areas, which vary by level of protection depending on the enabling laws of each country or the regulations of the international organizations involved.</p>
<p align="justify">The term "protected area" also includes Marine Protected Areas, the boundaries of which will include some area of ocean, and Transboundary Protected Areas that overlap multiple countries which remove the borders inside the area for conservation and economic purposes. There are over 161,000 protected areas in the world (as of October 2010) with more added daily, representing between 10 and 15 percent of the world's land surface area. By contrast, only 1.17% of the world's oceans is included in the world's ~6,800 Marine Protected Areas.</p>
<p align="justify">Protected areas are essential for biodiversity conservation, often providing habitat and protection from hunting for threatened and endangered species. Protection helps maintain ecological processes that cannot survive in most intensely managed landscapes and seascapes.</p>

<h4 style="color:green" id="benefits">Protected Area Benefits: Maintaining Our Life-Support Systems</h4>

<p align="justify">Protected areas provide a wide range social, environmental and economic benefits to people and communities worldwide. They are a tried and tested approach that has been applied for centuries to conserving nature and associated cultural resources by local communities, indigenous peoples, governments and other organisations.</p>

<p align="justify">More than instruments for conserving nature, protected areas are vital to respond to some of today’s most pressing challenges, including food and water security, human health and well-being, disaster risk reduction and climate change.</p>

<p align="justify">As the world continues to develop at a rapid pace, pressure on ecosystems and natural resources intensify. Protected areas, when governed and managed appropriately and embedded in development strategies, can provide nature-based solutions to this pressure, and take their place as an integral component of sustainable development.</p>


	
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman" align="justify">
<li>&nbsp;Supporting services - At a time when many agricultural systems are becoming
increasingly reliant on inputs of fertilisers, pesticides and
large amounts of fossil fuel energy, natural ecosystems
that are self-regulating and powered solely by the sun are
more rare. ‘Supporting processes and functions’ refer to
the basic running of an ecosystem: soil formation and
nutrient cycling; life-cycle maintenance for species by
provision of services like fish nursery habitats, means
of seed dispersal and continued species interactions;
along with conservation of the full range of biodiversity.
By protecting functioning ecosystems, protected areas
provide services to surrounding ecosystems, both through
the direct spillover of soils, nutrients and intercepted
solar energy and from the potential to use protected
areas as baselines of information and raw materials for
restoration within the rest of the landscape.
For example, demonstration of the opportunities for land
restoration through dryland habitat protection amasses
important information, and builds confidence, for
authorities to tackle desertification issues in the Arabian
Peninsula. Reductions of desertification and dust storms
are two concrete results that can become apparent in a
small number of years; however, major challenges here
are that a generation or more of people have grown up
believing that the highly degraded ecosystems covering
most settled parts of the peninsula are ‘natural’. Policy
changes rely not only on proof that protection and
restoration can work, but also on a long-term effort
to build understanding about ecology in the countries
concerned.</li><br>

<li>&nbsp;Provisioning services - Of more immediate interest to people are the various
tangible resources that protected areas either provide
directly or support.
	
<ul style="list-style-type: circle" align="justify"><br>
	<li>Food<br>
		Well-managed natural ecosystems play a key role in food
security, particularly for the poorest members of society,
many of whom are still leading a subsistence lifestyle and
are dependent on a diversity of edible products from
protected areas. For example, freshwater and marine
protected areas and coastal mangroves provide valuable
breeding grounds for fish, ensuring the populations do
not collapse and providing spillover into surrounding
waters (Roberts and Hawkins 2000). Many marine protected areas also allow sustainable fishing for local
communities, or follow traditional seasonal closures.
Terrestrial protected areas also enhance food security, by
such measures as providing emergency grazing during
times of drought in drylands, sources of fodder as long
as this is harvested in a sustainable manner and even
allowing controlled extraction of food species from
within the protected area boundaries. Illegal overhunting
within protected areas is conversely a major problem.
The use of protected areas as ‘emergency’ food supplies
is highlighted, for instance, in some parts of northern
and eastern Africa (Dudley et al. 2008).</li><br>
<li>Water<br>
Some ecosystems also increase the net amount of
available water, particularly watersheds containing cloud
forests, where leaves ‘scavenge’ water from mist and
cloud, condensing it on specially evolved leaf parts and
then funnelling it down branches and trunks. The city
of Tegucigalpa in Honduras is one of several large Latin
American cities that protect surrounding cloud forest
to guarantee water supplies, in this case in the La Tigra
National Park (Hamilton 2008). In some ecosystems
forests can hold more rainfall in the catchment than
cleared land, reducing water export and (depending
on geology) increasing aquifer storage (Siriwardena
et al. 2006).
</li>
<br>
<li>Raw materials<br>
Many protected areas have been established explicitly to
conserve natural resources such as timber and valuable
plants. But an increasing number also sanction some
level of collection, usually by local communities and
focusing on items like poles for building and fencing,
grasses for thatching, firewood and more valuable timber
for carving, boatbuilding and numerous other nontimber forest products (NTFPs). Some extractive reserves
(IUCN Category VI) have been set up explicitly to allow
sustainable harvesting of key products from natural
ecosystems; here protection and production inherently
go hand-in-hand. Rubber collecting in Amazonian
extractive reserves is the original, classic example. The
Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve in Brazil
is part of a large conservation complex of more than
6 million hectares where biodiversity conservation is
balanced with the needs of sustainable development. But
today such approaches are being used in land and waterbased protected areas throughout the world; it is now
the fastest-growing of all protected area management
categories.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top" style="color:lightslategray">Back to Top &uarr;</a></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle" align="justify">
<li>Medicinal resources<br>
Protected areas help support public health in a number
of ways: by providing a sustainable source of medicinal
herbs that are still the medicines of choice for the
majority of the world’s poor people, and providing
genetic resources for pharmaceutical companies, some
of which have signed agreements to pay prospecting
rights to individual protected areas. Ethno-botanical
studies have been conducted in numerous protected
areas, showing not only the wide range of values these
places contain, but also that in many parts of the world
some species, and sometimes also the knowledge on
using these species, is increasingly being confined to
protected areas. In countries such as Nepal, access to
medicinal herbs has declined so steeply in some areas
that management agreements to collect small amounts
in national parks are now the only remaining option
(Stolton and Dudley 2010b).
</li>
<br>
<li>Genetic resources<br>
As mentioned above, biodiversity has more than simply
aesthetic or ethical values, but provides raw material
for a range of products including the pharmaceuticals
already highlighted and particularly crop wild relatives
(CWR)—wild species that are closely related to
domesticated crops and which can supply valuable genes
for breeding to address issues such as drought tolerance
or resistance to disease (Stolton et al. 2006; Hunter and
Heywood 2011). Crop wild relatives already support the
multi-billion-dollar annual seed business and the need
for CWR is increasing all the time as environmental
conditions shift rapidly under climate change, throwing
agriculture under additional stress. Several microreserves have been established in Armenia, for instance,
to protect important CWR in one of the global centres
of crop diversity (see Boxes 6.2 and 6.6).
</li></ul><br>
<li>Regulating services - Well-managed natural ecosystems also maintain a range
of beneficial processes and functions with direct relevance
to human wellbeing. These so-called regulating services
refer mainly to the role of natural ecosystems in helping
to control aspects of climate, hydrology and the water
cycle, weather events and key natural systems that impact
on agriculture, such as pollination. Our understanding
of the value of these systems is increasing all the time.</li><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle" align="justify">
<li>Storing and sequestering carbon<br>
Although only recognised comparatively recently,
the role of natural ecosystems in both storing and
sequestering carbon, and thus reducing the rate of
climate change, is now for many people a primary
reason for conservation. Natural ecosystems form critical
carbon stores, including vegetation such as forests,
grasslands, wetlands and marine vegetation including
seagrass and kelp beds, along with subsurface storage in
humus-rich soils and particularly peat. Conversely, their
destruction and subsequent release of carbon are factors
currently leading to runaway climate change. Protected
areas thus help both by preventing further losses of
carbon to the atmosphere and, in healthy ecosystems,
by sequestering additional carbon (Dudley et al. 2009).
The UN Environment Programme’s World Conservation
Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC 2008) has
calculated that a minimum of 15 per cent of the world’s
stored carbon is already within protected areas. The
opportunity to add to this through sequestration means
that role of restoration in protected areas thus becomes
increasingly important (Keenleyside et al. 2012). Canada
is amongst the countries to have estimated the carbon
storage benefits of its existing national park system. 
In 2000, its then 39 national parks were estimated to
store 4.432 billion tonnes of carbon (Kulshreshtha et
al. 2000). Carbon management is seen as an important
factor in persuading governments to conserve natural
ecosystems, although current compensation schemes
proposed under Reducing Emissions from Deforestation
and Forest Degradation (REDD+) are not usually
enough on their own to make up for values forgone in
development. Carbon financing also expands the scope
for the strategic growth of protected areas to encompass
degraded or deforested land that is regrown, replanted
or restored to protect ecosystems, endangered species or
habitats, including corridors, which also contribute to
adaptation to climate change.</li>
<br>
<li>Mitigation of natural hazards<br>
Natural ecosystems also make cost-effective ways of
mitigating various extreme weather events and the after
effects of major earth movements; many of the former
are becoming more frequent and more intense due to
climate change. Natural ecosystems in protected areas can
mitigate a wide range of hazards: 1) natural vegetation
including particularly forests can help to control landslip
due to snowfall and avalanche, hillside soil erosion or earth
movement; 2) mangroves, coral reefs and sand dunes all
act as barriers against storms, typhoons, sea-level rise and
ocean surge following tsunamis; 3) riverside forest and
protected natural floodplains help to absorb floodwaters;
4) natural vegetation in dryland and arid areas can
prevent desertification, and reduce dust storms and
dune movement; and 5) several intact forest ecosystems,
particularly in the tropics, are far more resistant to fire
than degraded or fragmented ecosystems (Stolton et al.
2008). The term mitigation needs to be defined clearly.
No-one is suggesting that natural vegetation can prevent
all damage from every extreme weather event, any more
than can engineering solutions such as dykes, levees and
firebreaks. But experience suggests that well-managed
ecosystems can prevent or reduce damage from many,
often most, such events and save money and lives in the
process (Stolton et al. 2008).
</li><br>
<li>Purification and detoxification of water,
air and soil<br>
In an increasingly polluted world, ways of reducing the
pollution load are urgently required. Natural ecosystems,
if not overwhelmed, can help reduce many forms of
pollution. Forests and vegetation types such as paramos
in Latin America naturally produce pure water, and some
freshwater plants play an active role in detoxification
of certain pollutants. For example, in Florida’s cypress
swamps, 98 per cent of all nitrogen and 97 per cent of
all phosphorous entering the wetlands from wastewater
were removed before this water entered the groundwater
reservoirs (Ramsar Convention Bureau 2008). Research
found that one-third of the world’s 100 largest cities
draw a substantial proportion of their drinking water
from forest protected areas (Dudley and Stolton 2003).
Similarly, forests and other vegetation types can absorb
a certain amount of air pollution and provide valuable
shading. The ability of an ecosystem to neutralise
pollutants is significant and important, but by no means
infinite, and high pollution levels are also a major threat
to some protected areas, most dramatically in the case
of ocean acidification due to rising carbon dioxide levels
in the atmosphere. Wetland protected areas also provide
valuable water storage services, and protection of buffer
zones around lakes and rivers helps to prevent pollution.
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top" style="color:lightslategray">Back to Top &uarr;</a></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle" align="justify">
<li>Pollination<br>
Apart from its critical role in maintaining species diversity
and vegetation patterns, pollination has direct utilitarian
roles for humans, as an essential part of agriculture and
fruit growing, and as a stimulant for the production of
honey. In a world where pesticides, industrial pollution
and habitat loss have had a catastrophic impact on insect
numbers, protected areas are increasingly being seen
as a tool for maintaining pollination services. Many
protected areas allow local beekeepers to place beehives
with native bee species within the protected area. Farmers
benefit from pollination services maintained within the
protected area itself and spilling out into farmland and
orchards, and protected area planners are starting to
realise that they need to include the retention and where
necessary restoration of pollination pathways within
conservation planning exercises.
</li><br>
<li>Pest and disease regulation<br>
Controlling serious pests and diseases is increasingly
important as the degree of threat from invasive alien
species is recognised and climate change encourages
the spread of pests and diseases into new ecosystems.
Protected areas can help minimise these problems in
a number of ways, particularly by physically blocking
unwanted species: many invasive plants are coloniser
species and do not penetrate into mature vegetation.
The same is true of some insect pests like the tsetse fly,
and malarial mosquitoes have also been recorded as
moving far more slowly through dense forests.
</li></ul><br>
<li>Cultural services - Clearly not all the benefits we derive from natural
ecosystems are narrowly utilitarian: humans enjoy
a wealth of complicated cultural, psychological and
spiritual links with the natural world. Because protected
areas tend to be established in particularly beautiful
and pristine parts of nature, these cultural services are
particularly strongly represented.</li><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle" align="justify">
<li>Recreation and tourism<br>
The day-to-day uses of nature for relaxation, exercise and
psychological renewal stretch back way beyond recorded
history and have been a major driver for protected area
creation. Most visitors tend to cluster around the edges
of large reserves and keep to footpaths—for walks, family
outings, picnics and nature watching; a smaller subset of
visitors likes to penetrate much deeper, walking, riding
or canoeing for days inside the larger national parks.
For these people, the sense of isolation and wilderness is
a key part of the attraction. With tourism now arguably 
the world’s largest single industry, the potential for
ecotourism in protected areas is growing all the time and
is already the largest foreign currency earner in countries
such as Tanzania.
</li><br>
<li>(Nature-based) physical and mental
wellbeing<br>
As well as the benefits from recreational use of protected
areas, research and practice have found that people with
physical and mental problems or alcohol and other drug
addictions can benefit positively from immersion in an
attractive landscape. Health authorities in the United
Kingdom are encouraging use of local nature reserves
as safe and appealing places for exercise, to combat a
national obesity problem. The ‘Healthy Parks Healthy
People’ movement, started in Melbourne, Australia,
links protected area and health agencies and uses parks
to provide relaxing places for people with mental health
issues and/or substance addiction. These approaches have
proved very encouraging and a pleasant environment has
proven to be good psychological and physical therapy.</li><br>

<li>Aesthetic value and a sense of place
and inspiration for arts, science and
technology<br>
Perceptions of beauty are culturally formed.
The Romantic movement in the arts was a major
stimulus for the development of national parks in
Europe (Box 6.3). Iconic national parks like Yellowstone
in the United States, the Blue Mountains outside
Sydney, Australia, the Lake District in the United
Kingdom and the Japanese Alps have inspired artists
and writers for generations, and on a more local scale
protected areas provide rich sources of ideas and energy
for poets, painters, musicians and other artists. A ‘sense
of place’ is also a useful concept for describing and
understanding the attachments some people form with
protected areas (Lin and Lockwood 2013). Such place
attachments can include emotional (including identity)
and functional aspects even for communities who have
only recent connections with a protected area.</li><br>
<li>Education and research<br>
Protected areas provide an ideal location for ecological
research as they are often in fairly pristine condition,
and have sympathetic staff and sometimes facilities for
visiting scientists. A proportion of reserves are set up
specifically for research purposes, and these are amongst
the most strictly protected areas in terms of access and
disturbance, so ecological processes and interactions can
be studied under the best possible circumstances. Other
protected areas have extensive education programs, often
developed in association with local schools and colleges,
giving children an increasingly rare opportunity to
interact directly with nature.</li><br>

<li>Spiritual and religious experience<br>
Many protected areas contain sites of spiritual importance
(see Chapters 4 and 23). Protected areas can, if sensitively
managed, accommodate such interests, and can provide
both additional protection and a pleasant surrounding
environment for meditation and worship. In Amber
Mountain National Park, northern Madagascar, local
people can visit a sacred waterfall within the park, and
in Donaña National Park in southern Spain every year
a major pilgrimage takes place, linked to the Catholic
Church. To an increasing extent, resident faith groups
within protected areas are becoming actively involved in
conservation, as in Rila National Park in Bulgaria, where
the monks in Rila Monastery manage their own lands as
a nature reserve, in accordance with teachings about the
sanctity of nature.</li>
<br>
<li>Cultural identity and heritage<br>
The cultural and historical values found within protected
areas are also often very important although sometimes
rather difficult to define. In the same way that iconic
buildings, writers, musicians and football teams can
come to embody the heart of a nation or region, so too
can special views, landscapes or wild species. Climbing
Mount Triglav, in the national park of the same name, is
something many Slovenians intend to do at least once in
their life. Further east in Europe, Mount Kazbegi has a
potent mixture of cultural and spiritual values for many
Georgians, who visit the ancient church built high in the
mountains under its shadow.</li><br>

<li>Peace and stability<br>
Many conflicts between nation-states focus on the borders
between countries. The first trans-boundary conservation
initiative in the modern sense of the term is attributed
to the Waterton–Glacier International Peace Park, which
was declared in 1932 to commemorate the peace and
goodwill that exist along the world’s longest undefended
border, between Canada and the United States. Several
other trans-boundary protected areas have been effective
in helping resolve boundary disputes between countries.
For example, the establishment of protected areas in the
Carpathian Mountains in Central and Eastern Europe
between 1949 and 1967 helped settle boundary disputes,
and the Cordillera del Cóndor Transboundary Protected
Area along a portion of the border between Ecuador
and Peru was declared as part of the resolution of a
boundary dispute between the two countries.</li><br>

<h4 style="color:green" id="challenges">Challenges</h4>
<p align="justify">How to manage areas protected for conservation brings up a range of challenges - whether it be regarding the local population, specific ecosystems or the design of the reserve itself - and because of the many unpredicatable elements in ecology issues, each protected area requires a case-specific set of guidelines.

Enforcing protected area boundaries is a costly and labour-heavy endeavour, particularly if the allocation of a new protected region places new restrictions on the use of resources by the native people which may lead to their subsequent displacement. This has troubled relationships between conservationists and rural communities in many protected regions and is often why many Wildlife Reserves and National Parks face the human threat of poaching for the illegal bushmeat or trophy trades, which are resorted to as an alternative form of substinence.

There is increasing pressure to take proper account of human needs when setting up protected areas and these sometimes have to be "traded off" against conservation needs. Whereas in the past governments often made decisions about protected areas and informed local people afterwards, today the emphasis is shifting towards greater discussions with stakeholders and joint decisions about how such lands should be set aside and managed. Such negotiations are never easy but usually produce stronger and longer-lasting results for both conservation and people.

In some countries, protected areas can be assigned without the infrastructure and networking needed to substitute consumable resources and subtantiatively protect the area from development or misuse. The soliciting of protected areas may require regulation to the level of meeting demands for food, feed, livestock and fuel, and the legal enforcement of not only the protected area itself but also 'buffer zones' surrounding it, which may help to resist destabilisation.</p>	
<p><a href="#top" style="color:lightslategray">Back to Top &uarr;</a></p>

<h4 style="color:green" id="categories">Protected Area Categories</h4>

	<p align="justify">IUCN protected area management categories classify protected areas according to their management objectives. The categories are recognised by international bodies such as the United Nations and by many national governments as the global standard for defining and recording protected areas and as such are increasingly being incorporated into government legislation.</p>

<h5 style="color:green"><i>Category Ia: Strict Nature Reserve</i></h5>
	<p align="justify">Protected areas that are strictly set aside to protect biodiversity and also possibly geological/geomorphological features, where human visitation, use and impacts are strictly controlled and limited to ensure protection of the conservation values. Such protected areas can serve as indispensable reference areas for scientific research and monitoring.</p>

<h5 style="color:green"><i>Category Ib: Wilderness Area</i></h5>
	<p align="justify">Protected areas that are usually large unmodified or slightly modified areas, retaining their natural character and influence, without permanent or significant human habitation, which are protected and managed so as to preserve their natural condition.</p>	

<h5 style="color:green"><i>Category II: National Park</i></h5>	
	<p align="justify">Large natural or near natural areas set aside to protect large-scale ecological processes, along with the complement of species and ecosystems characteristic of the area, which also provide a foundation for environmentally and culturally compatible spiritual, scientific, educational, recreational and visitor opportunities.</p>
	
<h5 style="color:green"><i>Category III:Natural Monument or Feature</i></h5>		
	<p align="justify">Protected areas set aside to protect a specific natural monument, which can be a landform, sea mount, submarine cavern, geological feature such as a cave or even a living feature such as an ancient grove. They are generally quite small protected areas and often have high visitor value.</p>
	
<h5 style="color:green"><i>Category IV: Habitat/Species Management Area</i></h5>	
	<p align="justify">Protected areas aiming to protect particular species or habitats and management reflects this priority. Many category IV protected areas will need regular, active interventions to address the requirements of particular species or to maintain habitats, but this is not a requirement of the category.</p>

<h5 style="color:green"><i>Category V: Protected Landscape/Seascape</i></h5>
	<p align="justify">A protected area where the interaction of people and nature over time has produced an area of distinct character with significant ecological, biological, cultural and scenic value: and where safeguarding the integrity of this interaction is vital to protecting and sustaining the area and its associated nature conservation and other values.</p>

<h5 style="color:green"><i>Category VI: Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources</i></h5>	
	<p align="justify">Protected areas that conserve ecosystems and habitats, together with associated cultural values and traditional natural resource management systems. They are generally large, with most of the area in a natural condition, where a proportion is under sustainable natural resource management and where low-level non-industrial use of natural resources compatible with nature conservation is seen as one of the main aims of the area.</p>
